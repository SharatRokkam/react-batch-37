Controlled and Uncontrolled Components ? - FORM

1. Controlled Components in react are those where form data is handled by react component state.

This means : 
--> state management : the value of the input field by controlled by react state(useState or this.state in class component)
--> event handlers : changes to the input field(like typing into the text field) are handled by react event handlers (onChange, onBlur) etc.
--> State updates : when the user interacts with the form input, react state is updated through event handlers, and the input value reflects the current state value.

2. Uncontrolled Components in react are those where  form data is handled by the DOM itself.

This means:
-->Direct DOM manipulation : The value of the input field is controlled by the DOM.
-->Event Handling : Changes are directly handled by DOM events. (onChange, onBlur)
--> Accessing Form Data : Form data is accessed through refs or DOM traversal method, not through react state.


Controlled - complex form where data is critical and you want to have control on the component

Uncontrolled - simple form where you are not much worried about the form data
