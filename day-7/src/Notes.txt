Lifecycle Methods in react is a special method that get called at different stages of components life in the react rendering process. 

1. Mounting - When a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
2. Updating - When the component's state and props changes causing a re-rendering
3. Unmounting - When the component is being removed from the DOM
4. Error Handling - When a error occurs during the rendering in a lifecycle method.

Mounting - render, componentDidMount 
Updating - shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate
Unmounting - componentDidUnmount
