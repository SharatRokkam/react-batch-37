What is React ? 
--> React is JS library , which is developed by facebook...
---> Web application and Mobile application
--> REact DOM and React Native

Why React ?
--> Component - Flexible
--> learning curve is steep or easy
--> wide range of community support

Library and Framework ? (Imp)
--> Both are just a code written some developer and has kept on internet....
--> "Inversion of Control"
--> Library - Developer has control , framework - framework has the control...
---> Bootstrap = navbar but structure
--> React - without the structure we can create the project...

Example : Pizza maker Kit( base, spreads, oregano and veggies and chicken) -  Framework


Pizza Expert - Large, Creams, chicken, ketchup, spicy - Library
